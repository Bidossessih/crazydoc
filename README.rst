Crazydoc is a Python library to read a popular DNA sequence representation format: the joyfully coloured and stylishly annotated MS-Word document.

While other DNA representation such as FASTA, Genbank, or SBOL are better supported by modern sequence editors, none seems to have reached the ubiquitousness that MS-Word enjoys among molecular biologists.

Although this format offers great flexibility and is only limited by the degree of sophistication and creativity of its users, making it difficult to define, this library is an attempt to quickly convert MS-Word DNA sequences to more boring formats such as FASTA or annotated Genbanks.

Usage
-----

To obtain all sequences contained in a docx as annotated Biopython records:

.. code:: python

    from crazydoc import CrazydocParser
    parser = CrazydocParser(['highlight_color', 'bold', 'underline'])
    biopython_records = parser.parse_doc_file("./example.docx")

You can then plot the obtained records:

.. code:: python

    from crazydoc import CrazydocSketcher
    sketcher = CrazydocSketcher()
    for record in biopython_records:
        sketch = sketcher.translate_record(record)
        ax, _ = sketch.plot()
        ax.set_title(record.id)
        ax.figure.savefig('%s.png' % record.id)

    </p>

To write the sequences down as Genbank records, with annotations:

.. code:: python

    from crazydoc import records_to_genbank
    records_to_genbank(biopython_records)

Installation
-------------

(soon) You can install crazydoc through PIP

.. code::

    sudo pip install crazydoc

Alternatively, you can unzip the sources in a folder and type

.. code::

    sudo python setup.py install
